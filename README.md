Spanish Sonnet Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks LSTM

New Chanuwas, Kevin Karabinas, Khanh Le, Steven Ly

Our project will generate spanish sonnets using a bigram model as baseline, and a RNN LSTM model. Users can provide
input text as a topic for the generated poems. We use word2vec word embeddings trained on the Spanish Billion Words
corpus to get related words that are later chunked into rhyme classes. Our poems will be evaluated by human evaluators
on rhyme structure, coherency, and fluency.
